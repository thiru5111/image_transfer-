# DESCRIPTION:
So this project is about image tranfer using client/server architecture in python,
images will be transferred based on the request from the clients that is 
multiple clients can connect with the server and get multiple images,this is not an web application
its a normal python application where server file should be in one system's 
directory(any dir) and client should be in another system's directory(any dir) so that images 
will be transferred from one system to another. I used TCP connection for 
connecting client system and server system GUI(Graphical User-Interface) is done with help of easygui package
and image is displayed with the help of cv2 package.


FUTURE PLAN:
As of now we can transfer only .jpg image format in future many image formats like .gif,.png,.tiff etc can be transfered.
